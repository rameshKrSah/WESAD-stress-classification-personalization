# Code for the Representation Learning for Stress Classification and Personalization paper

There are two python scripts, results, and trained models in this repository. The dataset is not present in the repository and anyone interested in replicating the experiments needs to download and process the WESAD dataset. The WESAD dataset is publicly available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD+%28Wearable+Stress+and+Affect+Detection%29).
